# Code Convention — Moongate

This document defines coding conventions for the Moongate project. It is intentionally strict to keep the codebase consistent and readable.

## 1. General Principles

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep domain boundaries explicit.
- Keep files small and focused.
- Avoid hidden magic and implicit behavior.
- Write code that is easy to reason about during debugging.

## 2. Project Structure and Namespaces

### 2.1 Folder-to-Namespace Rule

Namespace must match folder path exactly.

```
src/Moongate.Core/Geometry/Point3D.cs                          → namespace Moongate.Core.Geometry;
src/Moongate.Server/Services/Persistence/WorldSaveService.cs   → namespace Moongate.Server.Services.Persistence;
tests/Moongate.Tests/Server/Services/Events/EventBusServiceTests.cs → namespace Moongate.Tests.Server.Services.Events;
```

### 2.2 Domain-First Organization

Group by domain first, not by technical suffix.

### 2.3 Mandatory Namespace Buckets

| Bucket | Content |
|---|---|
| `Types` | Enums, type constants (domain-prefixed) |
| `Data` | DTOs, records, simple data carriers |
| `Data.Config` | Configuration models |
| `Data.Internal.*` | Internal-only data models |
| `Interfaces` | Contracts only |
| `Services` | Service implementations |
| `Extensions` | Extension members, grouped by the type they extend |
| `Attributes` | Custom attributes |
| `Internal` | Implementation details not part of public API |

Each bucket takes a domain subfolder once it holds more than a handful of types: `Types/Accounts`,
`Data/Sessions`, `Interfaces/Services`, `Extensions/Strings`.

## 3. C# File and Type Rules

- One `.cs` file must contain at most one primary type (`class`, `record`, or `enum`).
- File name must match type name.
- Use file-scoped namespaces.
- Methods use block bodies (`{ }`), including single-statement methods. Do not use expression-bodied methods (`=>`).
  This rule is enforced by `.editorconfig` (IDE0022) and the CI style check; lambda expressions and property/accessor styles are unchanged.
- Do **not** use primary constructors.
- Do **not** use expression-bodied constructors (`public X(...) => ...`); constructors must always have a body `{ }`.

### 3.1 Indentation

C# uses spaces with an indentation size and tab width of **4**, as defined in `.editorconfig`.
Continuation lines use a single indentation level rather than alignment to the preceding expression,
argument or declaration. The ReSharper alignment settings are explicit in `.editorconfig` and the
solution's shared `.DotSettings` layer so Rider's formatter, inspections and the `jb` command-line
tools use the same indentation regardless of personal alignment preferences.
Keep Rider's indentation inspections enabled and fix the source when they report a mismatch.
Use the shared **CSharp formatting only** profile to apply indentation, spacing, line wrapping and
XML documentation formatting without code cleanup or member reordering:

```sh
jb cleanupcode Moongate.slnx --profile="CSharp formatting only" --include="**/*.cs" --no-build
```

## 4. Class Layout Order

Inside a type, use this order:

1. `const` fields
2. `private readonly` fields (prefixed `_`)
3. Non-readonly fields
4. Properties
5. Constructor(s)
6. Public methods
7. Protected methods
8. Private methods
9. `Dispose`/finalization methods (always last)

### 4.1 Private Readonly Naming

All `private readonly` fields must start with `_`:

```csharp
private readonly IEventBusService _eventBus;
private readonly DirectoriesConfig _directoriesConfig;
```

### 4.2 Dispose Position

If a class implements `IDisposable` or `IAsyncDisposable`, `Dispose`/`DisposeAsync` must be the last method(s) in the file.

An IDE rearrange pass sorts members by kind and accessibility, which lifts `Dispose` above the methods it
tears down. EditorConfig has no member-ordering property and `dotnet format` never reorders members, so this
rule lives in `Moongate.slnx.DotSettings` — Rider's *Rearrange Members* reads the file layout from there — and
`tests/Moongate.Tests/Conventions/DisposeMemberOrderTests.cs` fails the build when a formatter moves them.

## 5. Interfaces

- Interfaces live only under `Interfaces` namespaces.
- Every interface, and every member it declares, carries XML docs (`///`) **written in English**. Release
  builds emit the documentation file and the NuGet packages ship it, so these comments are the public
  reference for the libraries, not notes for the next reader of the source.
- Interface names must use `I` prefix and clear domain naming.

### 5.1 XML Documentation Layout

Use separate lines for opening tags, documentation text and closing tags. This applies to XML
documentation throughout the codebase, not only interfaces. Keep self-closing references such as
`<see cref="IDisposable" />`, `<paramref name="value" />` and `<inheritdoc />` intact.

```csharp
/// <summary>
///     Numeric value of the Debug level.
/// </summary>
```

The XMLDOC rules in `.editorconfig` control this layout in Rider/ReSharper. To apply them without
reformatting code or rearranging members, use the shared **XML documentation only** cleanup profile:

```sh
jb cleanupcode Moongate.slnx --profile="XML documentation only" --no-build
```

## 6. Enums

- Enums must live under a `Types` namespace, in the subfolder of the domain they belong to.
- Always include the domain in the enum name.

```csharp
// Types/LogLevelType.cs
namespace Moongate.Core.Types;
public enum LogLevelType { ... }

// Types/Accounts/AccountType.cs
namespace Moongate.Server.Core.Types.Accounts;
public enum AccountType { Regular = 0, GameMaster = 1, Administrator = 2 }
```

- A flags enum gives every member an explicit value and declares a zero member, so that
  `HasFlag` cannot answer true for an unset value.

## 7. Strings

- Empty strings have no imposed form. Neither `""` nor `string.Empty` is the standard: leave whichever
  a file already uses and do not convert in either direction.

## 8. Logging

- Use Serilog **statically** via `Log.ForContext<T>()`. Do not inject `ILogger<T>` via DI.
- Declare the logger as a `private readonly` field initialized inline.

```csharp
private readonly ILogger _logger = Log.ForContext<MyService>();
```

- Where a project namespace shadows a framework type, qualify or alias rather than renaming the namespace.
  `Moongate.Server.Services.Console` shadows `System.Console`, so that code writes `System.Console.WriteLine`.
- Use static message templates; never use string interpolation for structured logs.
- Keep template shape stable across calls.

## 9. Event Bus

- All event types must implement `IMoongateEvent`.
- `IMoongateEventBus` declares the bus: `Subscribe<TEvent>` returns an idempotent `IDisposable`, and
  `PublishAsync<TEvent>` emits. Services inject `IEventBusService`, which is that contract plus
  `IMoongateService`, so both reach the one container-owned bus.
- Handlers run sequentially in registration order and the publisher awaits each. One failing handler is
  logged and does not skip the handlers after it. Events are routed by exact type, and a late subscriber
  never receives an earlier event.
- `SubscribeAll` receives every published event regardless of type, dispatched after that event's typed
  subscribers, and follows the same sequential-await, idempotent-disposal, fault-isolated rules.

- A service subscribes in `StartAsync` and disposes the token in `StopAsync`, never in the constructor:
  a singleton's constructor runs only when something resolves it, so a constructor subscription is
  silently absent until then.

```csharp
internal sealed class MySubscriber : IMoongateStartupService
{
    private readonly IEventBusService _eventBus;
    private IDisposable? _subscription;

    public MySubscriber(IEventBusService eventBus)
    {
        _eventBus = eventBus;
    }

    public Task StartAsync()
    {
        _subscription = _eventBus.Subscribe<MoongateStartedEvent>(HandleAsync);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task StopAsync()
    {
        _subscription?.Dispose();

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

- Plugins subscribe from `Register` with `container.OnEvent<TEvent>(handler)`, which the container owns
  for the lifetime of the host.

## 10. Plugin System

- Plugins implement `IMoongatePlugin`: a `MoongatePluginData Metadata` property and `void Register(Container)`.
  The Id uses reverse-domain format, `com.github.author.Moongate.plugins.name`, and is case-insensitive.
- `Register` registers services and event subscriptions. It never starts them; the host owns the container
  and the service lifecycle.
- Declare dependencies in `MoongatePluginData`. They are required, and a batch is validated and ordered
  before any `Register` callback runs, so duplicate ids, missing dependencies and cycles reject the whole
  batch rather than leaving half of it applied.
- Disk plugins live one bundle per directory under `plugins/`, where the directory name matches the entry
  assembly. Each bundle gets its own collectible load context; host assemblies are shared to preserve
  contract identity, and the rest resolve privately.

## 11. Startup Services / Subscribers

- Services that own work across the host lifetime implement `IMoongateStartupService`, which extends `IMoongateService` with `StartAsync()` and `StopAsync()`.
- Register them with `container.AddMoongateService<TContract, TService>(priority)`. Services start in ascending priority order and stop in reverse, so a dependency takes a lower number than its dependents; the default is `0`.
- If an optional dependency is unavailable at startup, log a `Warning` and return cleanly — do not bring the host down. Throw only when the server cannot run without it; the bootstrap then stops every service it already started, in reverse order.
- A service that only subscribes to events still implements `IMoongateStartupService` and subscribes in `StartAsync`, so that its subscription exists exactly while the host runs. Nothing is force-resolved from `Program.cs` to make a constructor run.

## 12. Test Conventions

### 12.1 Structure

```
tests/Moongate.Tests/<Domain>/<Subdomain>/<SubjectName>Tests.cs
namespace Moongate.Tests.<Domain>.<Subdomain>;
```

Examples:
```
tests/Moongate.Tests/Core/Geometry/Point3DTests.cs                  → namespace Moongate.Tests.Core.Geometry;
tests/Moongate.Tests/Server/Services/Events/EventBusServiceTests.cs → namespace Moongate.Tests.Server.Services.Events;
tests/Moongate.Tests/TestSupport/Persistence/WorldSaveFixture.cs    → namespace Moongate.Tests.TestSupport.Persistence;
```

Integration, contract and performance tests go in their own folder rather than beside unit tests:
`tests/Moongate.Tests/Integration/<Domain>/`. Nothing lives in the test project root.
A test that needs PostgreSQL or Redis must sit in an `Integration`, `Performance` or `Stress`
namespace, or carry the matching `Category` trait: `scripts/test.sh fast` leaves tests out by
that rule only, so a database test placed elsewhere breaks the fast suite.

### 12.2 Naming

- File: `<SubjectName>Tests.cs`
- Class: `<SubjectName>Tests`
- One main test class per file.
- Test method style: `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult`.

### 12.3 Test Support

- Shared fakes, builders, and fixtures go in `tests/Moongate.Tests/TestSupport/<Domain>/`, mirroring the
  domain layout of the tests that use them.
- `tests/Moongate.Tests/Support/` is the older location and still holds part of this material. Put new
  helpers in `TestSupport/`, and move an existing one when you are already editing it.
- Do not mix reusable test infrastructure into domain test files.

### 12.4 InternalsVisibleTo

Projects expose internals to their own test project:

```xml
<InternalsVisibleTo Include="Moongate.Tests" />
```

`Moongate.Persistence`, `Moongate.Server` and `Moongate.Ultima` grant it to `Moongate.Tests`;
`Moongate.Network` grants it to `Moongate.Network.Tests`.

## 13. Branching and Commits

### 13.1 Feature Workflow

Every feature takes the same three steps, in this order. None of them is optional.

1. **Open an issue first.** It describes the feature in detail: what it does, why it is wanted, how it
   behaves at its edges, and how it will be verified. The issue is the specification the work is judged
   against, so a title and a sentence are not an issue.
2. **Branch from `develop`**, named `feature/<short-name>`, carrying that one feature and nothing else.
3. **Open a pull request into `develop`** and link the issue. Work reaches `develop` through that
   request, never through a direct push.

Fixes follow the same path under `fix/<short-name>`. `main` receives `develop` at release time and takes
nothing else.

### 13.2 Commit Messages

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, etc.). Release versions are
  derived from them, so the type and any `!` breaking marker decide the next version number.
- Scope commits to the affected subsystem: `feat(persistence):`, `fix(network):`, `test(eventbus):`.
- Write every commit in English, subject and body alike.
- Never add AI attribution anywhere: no `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, and no generated-with line in a
  commit, pull request, issue or release note.

### 13.3 Release Documentation Review

Before **every release**, including patch releases, verify that the documentation matches the exact
code being released. This check is mandatory.

- Review the repository and library READMEs, `docs/`, public API XML comments, examples and release
  notes against the implementation, including configuration defaults, commands and deployment steps.
- Update outdated or missing documentation, remove claims about unsupported behavior, and verify
  documented commands and runnable examples against the release candidate.
- Record the review and relevant verification results in the release pull request. Resolve all
  documentation/code mismatches before publishing the release.

## 14. Non-Negotiable Hygiene

- No dead code.
- No TODO comments without a tracked follow-up.
- No inconsistent naming across domains.
- Keep warnings under control; do not normalize noisy warnings. The build is at zero warnings, so a new
  one is a regression.
- No primary constructors.
- No expression-bodied constructors.

## 15. Additional Conventions

**Nullability**
- Use nullable reference types consistently.
- Avoid null-forgiving (`!`) unless explicitly justified.

**Async naming**
- Async methods must end with `Async`.
- Include `CancellationToken` on I/O-bound public async methods.

**`ConfigureAwait(false)`**
- Use it in the library projects: `Moongate.Core`, `Moongate.Network`, `Moongate.Persistence`,
  `Moongate.Scripting`, `Moongate.Server.Core` and `Moongate.Server` (game loop, dispatcher, hosting). Some of
  their code is waited on synchronously (`Dispose` calling `StopAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, Lua), and a
  caller with a `SynchronizationContext` (a test runner, a future UI host) must not be blocked by it.
- Do not use it in game code (`Moongate.Server.Ultima`) or plugins. The server installs no
  `SynchronizationContext`, so it changes nothing there. It never brings a handler back to the game loop
  either: after an `await` the code runs on a pool thread, and state changes go through `RunOnGameLoopAsync`.

**Exception handling**
- Guard the arguments of public API surface with `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` and friends.
- Do **not** guard constructor dependencies that arrive from the container: let the container fail on a
  missing registration instead of repeating the check in every service.
- Do not swallow exceptions silently.

**Collection exposure**
- Expose `IReadOnlyList<>` or `IReadOnlyDictionary<>` where mutation by callers is not intended.

**No magic numbers**
- Replace protocol/timing literals with named constants.

**Using directives**
- `System` namespaces first, then every other namespace in alphabetical order. Third-party and project
  namespaces are not separated: `DryIoc` sits between `ConsoleAppFramework` and `Moongate.Core`.
- Add using aliases when a name is ambiguous across two libraries in scope.
